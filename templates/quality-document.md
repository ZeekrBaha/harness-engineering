# Quality Document

A quality snapshot for each product domain and architectural layer. Both agents
and humans use this to see where the codebase is strong and where it needs work.
Grades carry the `repo-engineering-review` evidence standard — back each grade
with a basis tagged **confirmed / likely / needs-runtime-verification**.

**Update cadence:** After each significant session, or before starting a new
phase of work. Run `/repo-engineering-review` to refresh.

**Grading scale:**

- **A**: All verification passing, clean lean architecture, agent-legible, stable tests, security gates met (RLS, server-side auth, no client secrets)
- **B**: Verification passing, mostly clean, minor gaps in legibility or test coverage
- **C**: Partially working, known gaps, some areas hard for agents to understand
- **D**: Not working, or major structural / security issues
